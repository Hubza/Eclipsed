### The Eclipsed osu! skin is a skin I've been working on for around a year now, It started off with the name Material++, (which you can find [here](https://github.com/Hubza/MPP-osu)) - Then it got renamed to Eclipsed, which brings us to now after a little time. 

This skin is somewhat WIP but you can always download the latest version at the download link below!

### [Download link](https://github.com/Hubza/eclipsed/releases/latest/download/Eclipsed.osk)

### Interested in pre-releases?
 Firstly, go to Code, you're probably there already, then go to releases, there you'll find a .osk file. Click it, and it will start downloading. Once it is done, open it. It will open osu!, but with the skin! If you want to revert/change it, go to the osu! options, then go to the section Skin (paint brush icon), and there you go!
